# Systemd Service Monitor Creator with Slack Alerts

## Overview

This Bash script creates a systemd service and timer to monitor and automatically restart a specified service if it goes down. It enhances the reliability of critical services by providing continuous monitoring, automatic recovery, and Slack notifications for important events.

## Features

- Creates a monitor script for any specified systemd service
- Sets up a systemd service to run the monitor script
- Configures a systemd timer to run the monitor service at regular intervals
- Automatically restarts the monitored service if it's found to be down
- Sends Slack notifications for service status and restart attempts
- Provides logging for all actions and service states
- Offers easy customization options at the top of the script

## Requirements

- Bash shell
- Root or sudo access
- `systemctl` command (part of systemd)
- `netstat` command (usually part of net-tools package)
- `curl` command (for sending Slack notifications)

## Usage

1. Save the script as `service_monitor_setup.sh`
2. Edit the customization options at the top of the script (see Customization section)
3. Make it executable:
   ```
   chmod +x service_monitor_setup.sh
   ```
4. Run the script with sudo, providing the service name and port:
   ```
   sudo ./service_monitor_setup.sh <service_name> <port>
   ```

Example:
```
sudo ./service_monitor_setup.sh mysql 3306
```

## Customization

At the top of the script, you'll find several variables that allow easy customization:

```bash
MONITOR_INTERVAL="10sec"
LOG_FILE=""
RESTART_ON_FAILURE="always"
RESTART_SEC="10"
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL"
SLACK_DOWN_MESSAGE=":warning: %s service is down. Attempting to restart..."
SLACK_RESTART_SUCCESS=":white_check_mark: %s service restarted successfully."
SLACK_RESTART_FAILURE=":x: Failed to restart %s service. Manual intervention required!"
```

Adjust these variables as needed for your specific use case.

## Function Explanations

### 1. log()

```bash
log() {
    local message="[$(date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')] $1"
    if [ -n "$LOG_FILE" ]; then
        echo "$message" >> "$LOG_FILE"
    else
        echo "$message"
    fi
}
```

This function handles logging. It adds a timestamp to each log message and either appends it to a file (if `LOG_FILE` is set) or prints it to the console.

Example usage:
```bash
log "Service started successfully"
```

### 2. command_exists()

```bash
command_exists() {
    command -v "$1" >/dev/null 2>&1
}
```

This function checks if a command exists on the system. It's used to verify that required commands are available before proceeding.

Example usage:
```bash
if command_exists "netstat"; then
    echo "netstat is available"
else
    echo "netstat is not installed"
fi
```

### 3. create_monitor_script()

This function creates the actual monitor script that checks the service status and performs restarts if necessary. It uses a heredoc to write the script content.

Key parts of the created script:

- `send_slack_alert()`: Sends notifications to Slack.
- Service status check: Uses `netstat` to check if the service is listening on the specified port.
- Service restart: Uses `systemctl` to restart the service if it's down.

### 4. create_service_file()

This function creates the systemd service file for the monitor script. It defines how systemd should run and manage the monitor script.

### 5. create_timer_file()

This function creates the systemd timer file, which determines how often the monitor service should run.

### 6. main()

The main function that orchestrates the entire process:
1. Creates the monitor script
2. Creates the service file
3. Creates the timer file
4. Reloads the systemd daemon
5. Enables and starts the timer

## Testing Commands

Here are some commands you can use to test and interact with the created service:

1. Check the status of your monitor service:
   ```
   sudo systemctl status <service_name>_monitor.service
   ```

2. View the logs of your monitor service:
   ```
   sudo journalctl -u <service_name>_monitor.service
   ```

3. List all timers to verify your monitor timer:
   ```
   systemctl list-timers --all
   ```

4. Manually run the monitor script:
   ```
   sudo /usr/local/bin/<service_name>_monitor.sh
   ```

5. Stop the monitored service to test the monitor:
   ```
   sudo systemctl stop <service_name>
   ```
   (The monitor should detect this and attempt to restart the service)

## Troubleshooting

- If the service isn't restarting as expected, check the monitor script logs.
- Ensure the service name provided matches the actual systemd service name.
- Verify that the port number is correct for the service you're monitoring.
- If Slack notifications aren't working, double-check your webhook URL.

## Security Considerations

- This script requires root privileges. Ensure it's stored securely.
- The Slack webhook URL is sensitive information. Keep it confidential.
- Consider the implications of automatic restarts in your environment.

# Ubuntu Logging and Journalctl Behavior

## Script Logging Behavior

In the script, when `LOG_FILE=""` (empty), the logging behavior is as follows:

1. The `log()` function in the script will output to stdout (standard output) instead of writing to a file.
2. Since this is a systemd service, stdout is captured by systemd and sent to the journal.

## Journalctl in Ubuntu 22.04 LTS LOG_FILE=""

Journalctl is part of systemd and manages system logs in Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. Here are key points about its behavior:

1. **Log Storage**: By default, logs are stored in `/var/log/journal/`.

2. **Persistence**:
   - Logs are persistent by default in Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
   - They survive reboots and are stored on disk.

3. **Log Rotation**:
   - Journald (the daemon behind journalctl) handles log rotation automatically.
   - It uses both time-based and size-based rotation policies.

4. **Default Limits**:
   - By default, journal size is limited to 10% of the file system size.
   - It's also capped at 4GB, regardless of file system size.
   - The oldest entries are removed when these limits are reached.

5. **Configuration**:
   - Main config file: `/etc/systemd/journald.conf`
   - Key settings:
      - `SystemMaxUse`: Maximum disk space used
      - `SystemKeepFree`: Minimum free space to be left
      - `MaxFileSec`: Time before rotating to a new file

6. **Disk Space Management**:
   - With default settings, your disk should not fill up with logs.
   - Journald is designed to manage its own storage efficiently.

## Viewing Logs

To view logs for your service:

```bash
journalctl -u service_name_monitor.service
```

## Customizing Log Retention

If you need to adjust log retention:

1. Edit `/etc/systemd/journald.conf`
2. Modify relevant settings (e.g., `SystemMaxUse=1G`)
3. Restart journald: `sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald`

## Best Practices

1. Regularly monitor disk usage: `journalctl --disk-usage`
2. Adjust retention policies if necessary for your use case
3. Consider forwarding important logs to a centralized log management system

### Systemd Restart Behavior Explanation

The lines you've highlighted are part of the configuration for the systemd service's restart behavior:

```bash
# Restart Behavior
RESTART_ON_FAILURE="always"
RESTART_SEC="10"
```

These settings are used when creating the systemd service file in the script. Let's break down what each of these means and how they work:

#### 1. RESTART_ON_FAILURE="always"

This corresponds to the `Restart` directive in the systemd service file.

- When set to "always", it means that systemd will always attempt to restart the service, regardless of the exit status or the reason for stopping.
- Other possible values include:
   - "no" (default): The service will not be restarted.
   - "on-success": Restart only if the service exited cleanly.
   - "on-failure": Restart if the service exited with a non-zero exit code or was terminated by a signal.
   - "on-abnormal": Restart if the service was terminated by a signal or timed out.
   - "on-abort": Restart if the service was terminated by an uncaught signal not resulting in a core dump.
   - "on-watchdog": Restart if the service's watchdog timeout was reached.

#### 2. RESTART_SEC="10"

This corresponds to the `RestartSec` directive in the systemd service file.

- It specifies the time to sleep before restarting a service (in seconds).
- In this case, systemd will wait 10 seconds before attempting to restart the service.
- This delay can be useful to:
   - Prevent rapid restart loops if the service is failing immediately upon start.
   - Allow time for any resources used by the service to be properly released before restarting.
   - Reduce system load in case of repeated failures.

#### How These Settings are Applied

In the script, these values are used when creating the systemd service file:

```bash
create_service_file() {
    cat <<EOF | sudo tee "/etc/systemd/system/${SERVICE_NAME}_monitor.service" > /dev/null
[Unit]
Description=$SERVICE_NAME Monitor Service
After=$SERVICE_NAME.service

[Service]
ExecStart=$SCRIPT_PATH
Restart=$RESTART_ON_FAILURE
RestartSec=$RESTART_SEC

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF

    log "Created systemd service file: ${SERVICE_NAME}_monitor.service"
}
```

#### Practical Implications

1. **Continuous Operation**: With `Restart=always`, the service will be restarted no matter how it exits. This ensures the monitoring service is always running.

2. **Failure Mitigation**: The 10-second delay (`RestartSec=10`) helps prevent rapid restart cycles if there's a persistent issue causing immediate failures.

3. **Resilience**: These settings make the monitoring service resilient to temporary failures or issues that might cause it to stop.

4. **Resource Management**: The restart delay helps manage system resources by preventing constant restart attempts in case of recurring issues.

5. **Debugging Consideration**: While this ensures high availability, it might mask underlying issues. It's important to monitor logs to catch and address recurring problems.

#### Customization

These values can be adjusted based on specific needs:
- Increase `RestartSec` for services that might need more time to fully stop before restarting.
- Change `Restart` to "on-failure" if you only want to restart on unexpected exits.


### Slack Webhook Integration Explanation

This section of the script sets up the integration with Slack for sending notifications about the monitored service's status. Let's break it down:

#### Slack Webhook URL

```bash
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL"
```

1. **What is a Slack Webhook?**
    - A webhook is a way for one application to provide real-time information to another application.
    - In this case, it allows our script to send messages directly to a specific Slack channel.

2. **How to Get a Webhook URL:**
    - Go to your Slack workspace's app directory
    - Create a new app or use an existing one
    - Enable "Incoming Webhooks" feature
    - Create a new webhook for a specific channel
    - Slack will provide you with a unique URL

3. **Security Note:**
    - The webhook URL is sensitive information. Anyone with this URL can post messages to your Slack channel.
    - In a production environment, you should use environment variables or a secure secrets management system to store this URL.

#### Slack Message Formats

```bash
SLACK_DOWN_MESSAGE=":warning: %s service is down. Attempting to restart..."
SLACK_RESTART_SUCCESS=":white_check_mark: %s service restarted successfully."
SLACK_RESTART_FAILURE=":x: Failed to restart %s service. Manual intervention required!"
```

These lines define the format of messages that will be sent to Slack:

1. **Message Structure:**
    - Each message starts with an emoji (e.g., ":warning:") for visual impact.
    - The `%s` is a placeholder that will be replaced with the actual service name when the message is sent.

2. **Emoji Usage:**
    - ":warning:" (⚠️): Indicates a problem (service is down)
    - ":white_check_mark:" (✅): Indicates success (service restarted successfully)
    - ":x:" (❌): Indicates failure (restart failed)

3. **Message Content:**
    - Each message clearly states the current status and any actions being taken or required.

4. **Formatting:**
    - Slack supports markdown and emoji codes in webhook messages.
    - You can further customize these messages with additional formatting if needed.

#### How These Are Used in the Script

In the monitoring script created by `create_monitor_script()`, there's a function to send Slack alerts:

```bash
send_slack_alert() {
    local message="$1"
    curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data "{\"text\":\"$message\"}" "$SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL"
}
```

This function is called at various points in the script:

```bash
send_slack_alert "$(printf "$SLACK_DOWN_MESSAGE" "$SERVICE_NAME")"
```

Here, `printf` is used to replace the `%s` in the message with the actual service name before sending it to Slack.

#### Benefits of This Approach

1. **Real-time Notifications:** Immediate alerts when services go down or are restarted.
2. **Customizable Messages:** Easy to modify message formats for different scenarios.
3. **Visual Differentiation:** Use of emojis helps quickly identify the nature of the alert.
4. **Centralized Communication:** All service alerts go to a designated Slack channel, making it easy for teams to stay informed.

#### Considerations

- Ensure your Slack channel doesn't get overwhelmed with notifications if a service is flapping (repeatedly going down and restarting).
- Consider implementing rate limiting or combining multiple alerts into summary messages for frequently occurring issues.
- Regularly review and update the webhook URL, especially if there are changes in your Slack workspace or security requirements.

### Logging Function

#### Function Definition

```bash
# Function to log messages
log() {
    local message="[$(date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')] $1"
    if [ -n "$LOG_FILE" ]; then
        echo "$message" >> "$LOG_FILE"
    else
        echo "$message"
    fi
}
```

#### Features

- Automatically adds timestamps to log messages
- Flexibly logs to a file or stdout based on configuration
- Simple to use and integrate into existing scripts

#### Usage

1. Copy the function into your Bash script.

2. (Optional) Set the `LOG_FILE` variable to specify a log file:
   ```bash
   LOG_FILE="/path/to/your/logfile.log"
   ```

3. Use the `log` function to log messages:
   ```bash
   log "Your message here"
   ```

#### Configuration

- If `LOG_FILE` is set to a file path, logs will be written to that file.
- If `LOG_FILE` is empty (`LOG_FILE=""`), logs will be sent to stdout (standard output).
- When logging to stdout, there's no need to manage log file size or rotation as the system's standard logging mechanisms (like journald) will handle this.

#### Examples

Logging to a file:
```bash
LOG_FILE="/var/log/myscript.log"
log "Script started"
# Appends "[2023-09-29 15:30:45] Script started" to /var/log/myscript.log
```

Logging to stdout:
```bash
LOG_FILE=""
log "Processing complete"
# Prints "[2023-09-29 15:31:00] Processing complete" to the terminal
```

#### Considerations

1. **Log Levels**: This function doesn't implement log levels (e.g., INFO, WARNING, ERROR). If needed, consider extending the function to include this functionality.

2. **File Management**: When logging to a file, this function doesn't manage file size or implement log rotation. For long-running scripts or systems, consider implementing log rotation or using system tools like `logrotate`.

3. **Concurrent Access**: If multiple instances of a script might write to the same log file concurrently, consider implementing file locking mechanisms.

4. **Performance**: For high-frequency logging, writing to a file might impact performance. Consider buffering logs or using more sophisticated logging libraries for such cases.

5. **Timezone**: The timestamp uses the system's local time. If working across timezones, consider using UTC or explicitly setting the timezone.

#### Customization

You can easily customize the timestamp format by modifying the `date` command in the function. For example, to include milliseconds:

```bash
local message="[$(date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%3N')] $1"
```

#### Integration with Systemd

When used in a systemd service, if `LOG_FILE` is empty, logs will automatically be captured by journald. You can view these logs using:

```bash
journalctl -u your_service_name.service
```

## Command Checking Functions

#### Function Definitions

```bash
# Function to check if a command exists
command_exists() {
    command -v "$1" >/dev/null 2>&1
}

# Check if required commands are available
check_required_commands() {
    for cmd in netstat systemctl curl; do
        if ! command_exists "$cmd"; then
            log "Error: $cmd is not installed. Please install it and try again."
            exit 1
        fi
    done
}
```


## `command_exists()`

This function checks if a given command is available in the system's PATH.

- `command -v "$1"`: Attempts to locate the command passed as an argument.
- `>/dev/null 2>&1`: Redirects both standard output and standard error to `/dev/null`, effectively silencing any output.
- The function relies on the exit status of the `command` built-in to determine if the command exists.

### `check_required_commands()`

This function uses `command_exists()` to check for a predefined list of required commands.

- It loops through a list of commands (`netstat`, `systemctl`, `curl`).
- For each command, it calls `command_exists()`.
- If a command doesn't exist, it logs an error message and exits the script with a status code of 1.

## Usage

1. Copy both functions into your Bash script.

2. Call `check_required_commands()` early in your script, before any operations that depend on these commands:

   ```bash
   check_required_commands
   ```

3. If you need to check for additional commands, modify the list in the `for` loop within `check_required_commands()`.

## Example

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function definitions here...

# Check for required commands
check_required_commands

# Rest of your script...
```

## Benefits

- **Early Error Detection**: Identifies missing dependencies before the script attempts to use them.
- **Clear Error Messages**: Provides specific feedback about which commands are missing.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to add or remove commands from the check list.

## Customization

You can easily modify the list of required commands by changing the `for` loop in `check_required_commands()`:

```bash
for cmd in command1 command2 command3; do
    # ... existing code ...
done
```

## Considerations

1. **Performance**: This check adds a small overhead to your script's startup time.
2. **Portability**: Ensure that the commands you're checking for are relevant across all systems where the script will run.
3. **Path Issues**: This method checks for commands in the current PATH. It won't find commands that exist on the system but aren't in the PATH.

## Integration with Logging

This example assumes the existence of a `log()` function for error reporting. Ensure you have a logging mechanism in place, or replace `log` with `echo` or another preferred output method.

### Service Monitor Script Creator

#### Function: `create_monitor_script()`

This function creates a Bash script that monitors a specific service. Here's a breakdown of its components:

1. **Script Creation**: Uses a heredoc to write the content of the monitoring script to a file specified by `$SCRIPT_PATH`.

2. **Shebang and Service Name**: Sets up the script with a Bash shebang and comments identifying the service being monitored.

3. **Error Handling**: Uses `set -euo pipefail` for strict error handling.

4. **Configuration**: Sets `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` and `LOG_FILE` variables.

5. **Logging Function**: Defines a `log()` function for consistent logging.

6. **Slack Alert Function**: Defines a `send_slack_alert()` function to send messages to Slack.

7. **Service Check**: Uses `netstat` to check if the service is listening on the specified port.

8. **Restart Logic**: Attempts to restart the service if it's down and logs the result.

9. **Notifications**: Sends Slack alerts for service status and restart attempts.

10. **Permissions**: Makes the created script executable.

#### Usage

To use this function in your main script:

1. Define necessary variables (`SCRIPT_PATH`, `SERVICE_NAME`, `SERVICE_PORT`, `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`, `LOG_FILE`, `SLACK_*_MESSAGE`).
2. Call the function: `create_monitor_script`

#### Generated Script Functionality

The generated script will:

1. Check if the specified service is running by looking for its port in the `netstat` output.
2. If the service is down:
    - Log the event
    - Send a Slack alert
    - Attempt to restart the service
    - Log and send Slack alerts about the restart result
3. If the service is running, it logs this information.

#### Configuration

Before using `create_monitor_script()`, ensure these variables are set:

- `SCRIPT_PATH`: Path where the monitor script will be created
- `SERVICE_NAME`: Name of the service to monitor
- `SERVICE_PORT`: Port number the service should be listening on
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`: Webhook URL for Slack notifications
- `LOG_FILE`: Path to the log file (or empty for stdout logging)
- `SLACK_DOWN_MESSAGE`, `SLACK_RESTART_SUCCESS`, `SLACK_RESTART_FAILURE`: Message templates for Slack notifications

#### Example

```bash
SCRIPT_PATH="/usr/local/bin/monitor_mysql.sh"
SERVICE_NAME="mysql"
SERVICE_PORT="3306"
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL"
LOG_FILE=""
SLACK_DOWN_MESSAGE=":warning: %s is down. Attempting restart..."
SLACK_RESTART_SUCCESS=":white_check_mark: %s restarted successfully."
SLACK_RESTART_FAILURE=":x: Failed to restart %s. Manual intervention required!"

create_monitor_script
```

you need to provide two mandatory positional parameters when running main script (keep default):

SERVICE_NAME: The name of the service to monitor
SERVICE_PORT: The port number the service should be listening on

#### Considerations

1. **Permissions**: The script uses `sudo` to restart the service. Ensure appropriate sudo permissions are configured.
2. **Network Commands**: The script uses `netstat`. Ensure this command is available or consider alternatives like `ss`.
3. **Customization**: You may need to adjust the service check or restart commands based on your specific service and system configuration.
4. **Security**: The generated script contains sensitive information (Slack webhook URL). Ensure it's stored securely with appropriate permissions.

#### Integration

This function is typically part of a larger script that sets up monitoring for various services. It can be called multiple times with different parameters to create monitoring scripts for multiple services.

## Systemd Service File Creator

#### Function: `create_service_file()`

#### Purpose

The `create_service_file()` function creates a systemd service file that defines how the monitoring script should be run as a system service.

#### Functionality

1. **File Creation**: Uses `cat` with a heredoc to generate the content of the service file.
2. **sudo tee**: Writes the content to the appropriate location in the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory with elevated privileges.
3. **Logging**: Logs the creation of the service file.

### Systemd Service File Structure

The generated service file contains:

1. **[Unit] Section**:
    - `Description`: Describes the purpose of the service.
    - `After`: Ensures this service starts after the main service it's monitoring.

2. **[Service] Section**:
    - `ExecStart`: Specifies the full path to the monitoring script.
    - `Restart`: Defines the restart behavior of the monitoring service.
    - `RestartSec`: Sets the time to wait before restarting the service.

3. **[Install] Section**:
    - `WantedBy`: Defines the target that should include this service when enabled.

#### Usage

This function is typically called within a larger script after setting necessary variables. Ensure the following variables are set before calling:

- `SERVICE_NAME`: Name of the service being monitored.
- `SCRIPT_PATH`: Full path to the monitoring script.
- `RESTART_ON_FAILURE`: Restart behavior (e.g., "always", "on-failure").
- `RESTART_SEC`: Time to wait before restart attempts.

Example usage within a script:

```bash
SERVICE_NAME="nginx"
SCRIPT_PATH="/usr/local/bin/nginx_monitor.sh"
RESTART_ON_FAILURE="always"
RESTART_SEC="10"

create_service_file
```

#### Output

The function creates a file named `${SERVICE_NAME}_monitor.service` in the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory. For example, if `SERVICE_NAME` is "nginx", the file would be `/etc/systemd/system/nginx_monitor.service`.

#### Permissions

This function requires sudo privileges to write to the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory. Ensure the script is run with appropriate permissions.

#### Post-Creation Steps

After creating the service file, you typically need to:

1. Reload the systemd daemon:
   ```
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

2. Enable the service (to start on boot):
   ```
   sudo systemctl enable ${SERVICE_NAME}_monitor.service
   ```

3. Start the service:
   ```
   sudo systemctl start ${SERVICE_NAME}_monitor.service
   ```

#### Customization

You can modify the function to add additional directives to the service file as needed. Common customizations include:

- Setting a specific user or group for the service
- Adding environment variables
- Specifying additional dependencies

#### Considerations

1. **Naming Conflicts**: Ensure the service name doesn't conflict with existing services.
2. **Permissions**: The created service file inherits permissions from systemd's directory. Ensure this meets your security requirements.
3. **Dependency Management**: The `After` directive ensures proper ordering but doesn't guarantee the monitored service is fully operational.

#### Troubleshooting

If the service doesn't start as expected:

1. Check the service status: `sudo systemctl status ${SERVICE_NAME}_monitor.service`
2. View logs: `sudo journalctl -u ${SERVICE_NAME}_monitor.service`


### Systemd Timer File Creator

#### Function: `create_timer_file()`

#### Purpose

The `create_timer_file()` function creates a systemd timer file that defines when and how often the associated monitoring service should run.

#### Functionality

1. **File Creation**: Uses `cat` with a heredoc to generate the content of the timer file.
2. **sudo tee**: Writes the content to the appropriate location in the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory with elevated privileges.
3. **Logging**: Logs the creation of the timer file.

#### Systemd Timer File Structure

The generated timer file contains:

1. **[Unit] Section**:
    - `Description`: Describes the purpose of the timer.

2. **[Timer] Section**:
    - `OnBootSec`: Specifies when the timer should start after boot.
    - `OnUnitActiveSec`: Defines the interval between timer activations.
    - `Unit`: Specifies which service unit to activate.

3. **[Install] Section**:
    - `WantedBy`: Defines the target that should include this timer when enabled.

#### Usage

This function is typically called within a larger script after setting necessary variables. Ensure the following variables are set before calling:

- `SERVICE_NAME`: Name of the service being monitored.
- `MONITOR_INTERVAL`: The interval at which the monitoring service should run.

Example usage within a script:

```bash
SERVICE_NAME="nginx"
MONITOR_INTERVAL="10min"

create_timer_file
```

#### Output

The function creates a file named `${SERVICE_NAME}_monitor.timer` in the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory. For example, if `SERVICE_NAME` is "nginx", the file would be `/etc/systemd/system/nginx_monitor.timer`.

#### Permissions

This function requires sudo privileges to write to the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory. Ensure the script is run with appropriate permissions.

#### Post-Creation Steps

After creating the timer file, you typically need to:

1. Reload the systemd daemon:
   ```
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

2. Enable the timer (to start on boot):
   ```
   sudo systemctl enable ${SERVICE_NAME}_monitor.timer
   ```

3. Start the timer:
   ```
   sudo systemctl start ${SERVICE_NAME}_monitor.timer
   ```

#### Customization

You can modify the function to add additional timer options as needed. Common customizations include:

- Adding `RandomizedDelaySec` for spreading out load
- Using `OnCalendar` for more complex scheduling
- Setting `Persistent=true` for catching up on missed runs

#### Considerations

1. **Naming Consistency**: Ensure the timer name matches the associated service file.
2. **Interval Selection**: Choose an appropriate interval that balances monitoring needs with system resources.
3. **System Impact**: Be aware that very frequent checks may impact system performance.

#### Troubleshooting

If the timer doesn't work as expected:

1. Check the timer status: `sudo systemctl status ${SERVICE_NAME}_monitor.timer`
2. List all timers: `sudo systemctl list-timers`
3. View logs: `sudo journalctl -u ${SERVICE_NAME}_monitor.timer`

#### Example Timer Intervals

- `5min`: Every 5 minutes
- `1h`: Every hour
- `1d`: Every day
- `1w`: Every week

### Service Monitor Main Execution Function

#### Function: `main()`

#### Purpose

The `main()` function coordinates the execution of all steps necessary to create, enable, and start a service monitoring system using systemd.

#### Functionality

1. **Logging**: Logs the start of the process.
2. **Script Creation**: Calls `create_monitor_script()` to generate the monitoring script.
3. **Service File Creation**: Calls `create_service_file()` to create the systemd service file.
4. **Timer File Creation**: Calls `create_timer_file()` to create the systemd timer file.
5. **Systemd Reload**: Reloads the systemd daemon to recognize new files.
6. **Enable and Start Timer**: Enables and starts the systemd timer for the monitor.
7. **Completion Log**: Logs the completion of the setup process.

#### Usage

This function is typically called at the end of the script after all necessary variables and functions have been defined:

```bash
main
```

#### Prerequisites

Before calling `main()`, ensure the following are set up:

1. All required variables (`SERVICE_NAME`, `SERVICE_PORT`, etc.) are defined.
2. The functions `create_monitor_script()`, `create_service_file()`, and `create_timer_file()` are defined.
3. The `log()` function for logging is available.

#### Execution Flow

1. **Initialization**: Logs the start of the process.
2. **Monitor Script Creation**: Creates the script that will check the service status.
3. **Systemd Service File Creation**: Creates a service file for systemd to manage the monitor script.
4. **Systemd Timer File Creation**: Creates a timer file to periodically trigger the monitor service.
5. **Systemd Reload**: Ensures systemd recognizes the new files.
6. **Timer Activation**: Enables and starts the timer to begin periodic monitoring.
7. **Completion**: Logs the successful completion of the setup.

## Permissions

This function requires sudo privileges to:
- Create files in system directories
- Reload the systemd daemon
- Enable and start systemd units

Ensure the script is run with appropriate permissions.

## Error Handling

While this function doesn't explicitly include error handling, it's recommended to add checks after each step to ensure each operation completes successfully.

## Customization

You can modify this function to include additional steps such as:
- Verifying the creation of each file
- Adding more detailed logging
- Implementing error handling and rollback procedures

## Troubleshooting

If the setup doesn't work as expected:
1. Check the logs generated by the `log()` function.
2. Verify each file was created correctly:
   - Monitor script
   - Systemd service file
   - Systemd timer file
3. Check systemd status:
   ```
   sudo systemctl status ${SERVICE_NAME}_monitor.service
   sudo systemctl status ${SERVICE_NAME}_monitor.timer
   ```

## Example

Assuming all prerequisites are met:

```bash
SERVICE_NAME="nginx"
SCRIPT_PATH="/usr/local/bin/nginx_monitor.sh"
# ... other variable definitions ...

main
```

This will set up a complete monitoring system for the Nginx service.
